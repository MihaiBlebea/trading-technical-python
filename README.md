Important Ratios:

- *P/E - Price earning ratio*
	- Calculated by market value per share / earnings per share

	- There are 2 types of P/E:

		- trailing - using historic data (TTM EPS)

		- forward - using future predicted EPS

- *EPS - Earnings per share*

	- EPS (TTM) is a Wall Street acronym for "trailing 12 months". This number signals the company's performance over the past 12 months.

	- The second type of EPS is found in a company's earnings release, which often provides EPS guidance. This is the company's best-educated guess of what it expects to earn in the future.
